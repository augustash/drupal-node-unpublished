<img src="https://badgen.net/badge/version/2.0/cyan?icon=github" alt="Version: 2.0"/>

Adds a new permission set to allow defined roles to view all unpublished nodes and alter node status.

Inspired by [Override Node Options](https://www.drupal.org/project/override_node_options) and [View Unpublished](https://www.drupal.org/project/view_unpublished)

## Usage
Download and enable the module. On install the permissions should be rebuilt automatically.
