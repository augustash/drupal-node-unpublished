# Node Unpublished

Adds a permission to allow roles to view all unpublished nodes and change node status.

Inspired by [Override Node Options](https://www.drupal.org/project/override_node_options) and [View Unpublished](https://www.drupal.org/project/view_unpublished)

## Usage
Download and enable the module. On install the permissions should be rebuilt automatically.
